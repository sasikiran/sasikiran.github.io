However, this UX concept designed by <a href="https://dribbble.com/isiluzum">Isil Uzum</a> with a Virgin Atlantic Messenger bot is very clever. </p>

<p>The premise is this -- <br>
John and Kathy while chatting on Messenger, think of buying flight tickets. Kathy launches flight search using =flight search shortcut. This triggers the flight bot, Virgin Atlantic in this case. Kathy gets to choose between Skyscanner and Kayak search engines for flights. She even makes Skyscanner as the default search engine. Then, she chooses a flight from JFK to SEA along with the start and end dates and makes it for 2 pax. Both John and Kathy get to fill in the passenger information and choose partial payment. Kathy only makes a partial payment. When both John and Kathy finish paying, their ticket confirmation pass is shown in the chat itself.</p>

<p>I’m not really a Spielberg fan but I wonder whether he actually foresaw that the future would be something like this, or was this a purely coincidence and part of his researched script? If Spielberg did actually predict it right, well that’s really brilliant! I would want him to make Minority Report 2 as well, so that we can have a peek into our future once again. <br>
I’ve seen other sci-fi movie directors, who took way too much liberty and introduced concepts like teleportation, time travel etc. I have a feeling that these things would remain a human fantasy for a long time and may not see the light.</p>

<p>There are also movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYziuMU2Ubs">Aditya 369</a> or the very recent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013">Oblivion</a>, where after an apocalypse, the survivors would be seen wearing a silver colored pinstripe jump suit with boots! Actually, Jerry Seinfeld made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceRsfMaQ4r0">a joke</a> on this.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
